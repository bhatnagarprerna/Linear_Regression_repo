# Linear_Regression_repo
This includes both simple and multiple linear regression methods.Simple and multiple linear regression are two common statistical techniques used to analyze datasets with one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
## Simple Linear Regression -
In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, and it is used to predict the dependent variable. The relationship between the two variables is assumed to be linear, and the goal is to find the best line that fits the data.Simple linear regression can be less accurate because it only takes into account one independent variable.

### Datasets - 
1. Supermarket Sales Dataset -
* Valuable insights into a supermarket sales dataset and help in understanding the factors that influence sales in the store. It can be useful for identifying trends, making predictions, and optimizing sales strategies. 

* The relationship between the independent variable (such as time or promotional offers) and the dependent variable (sales) can be analyzed. The regression coefficient provides information on the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.

* The model can be used to make predictions about future sales based on the values of the independent variable. For example, if time is the independent variable, the model can be used to predict sales for future time periods based on historical data.

* The model can be used to identify the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable. 

2. Hardware Dataset - 
* The relationship between the independent variable (such as price or quality rating) and the dependent variable (sales volume) can be analyzed. The regression coefficient provides information on the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.

* The model can be used to make predictions about future sales based on the values of the independent variable. For example, if price is the independent variable, the model can be used to predict sales volume for different price points.

* The model can be used to identify the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, if quality rating is the independent variable, the model can help identify the impact of quality on sales volume

## Multiple LInear Regression - 
In multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables that are used to predict the dependent variable. The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is also assumed to be linear, and the goal is to find the best line that fits the data taking into account all of the independent variables. Multiple linear regression can provide a more accurate prediction of the dependent variable because it considers multiple independent variables.

### Dataset -
Boston Housing Dataset - 
* The Boston Housing dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about the housing prices and various other factors that can influence the price of a house in the Boston area.

* The relationship between the various features and the target variable (housing price) can be analyzed. For example, the coefficient for the feature 'RM' (average number of rooms per dwelling) is expected to be positive, indicating that the price of a house increases with the number of rooms.

* The model can be used to make predictions about the price of a house based on the values of the input features. This can be useful for real estate agents or home buyers who want to estimate the price of a house based on its characteristics.
